 ## About
 As part of [my 100DaysOfCode journey](https://github.com/ananfito/100-days-of-code), I am learning how to program in JavaScript by creating a basic Tetris game following [this "Code Tetris" tutorial](https://youtu.be/rAUn1Lom6dw) on freeCodeCamp's YouTube Channel taught by [Ania Kubow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw).
