 basic tetris app using HTML, CSS, and JS.

 ## About
 As part of my 100DaysOfCode journey, I am learning how to program in JavaScript. As part of that journey I am creating a basic tetris game following the tetris tutorial on [freeCodeCamp's YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/rAUn1Lom6dw) taught by [Ania Kubow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw).
