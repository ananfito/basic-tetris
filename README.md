 ## About
 A basic Tetris app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScipt based on the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/rAUn1Lom6dw) taught by Ania Kubow. Like the well-known puzzle game, [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris), this app will have the same/similar functionality as its namesake. As a kid (and an adult) I was a huge fan of playing the game so this has been an ideal project for me to work on as I continue to study front-end web development.

 ## Status
 A live version of the game can be viewed [here](https://ananfito.github.io/basic-tetris/). The app is mostly functional with a few minor glitches I still haven't worked out.

 In particular, if a vertical-like Tetromino (e.g., the `I` or `L` shaped Tetromino) falls down on the far left side of the grid it will go past the bottom edge instead of stopping. This image below dispalys what I mean.

 If you know how to solve this problem or would like to help, I am very open to mentorship and collaboration. Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:ananfito@gmail.com). Thank you.
